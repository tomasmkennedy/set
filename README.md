## How to Play Set
    The object of the game is to identify as many "sets" as you can from 12 cards placed face up on your screen. Each card has four features, shape (oval, rectangle, or diamond), color (red, blue, or green), number (one, two, or three), and shading (solid, striped, or outlined).

    A **set** consists of 3 cards in which each of the cards' features, when looked at one-by-one are the same on each card or different on each card. All of the features, seperately, much satisfy this rule.

    To see examples, go to the **How to Play** tab in the navigation bar.
